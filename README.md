# Type Form PHP Library for accessing the in development form API


## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require axolotlinteractive/typeform
```

Right now the project initalizes a guzzle client with the user's api key, and has api available to post to the form and end point with all object helpers.
Other end points will be implemented in the future.
API version 0.4 is the only supported version, but more will be added in the future.
