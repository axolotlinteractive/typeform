# Type Form PHP Library for accessing the in development form API


## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require axolotlinteractive/typeform
```

Right now the project just initalizes a guzzle client with the user's api key.
API version 0.4 is the only supported version, but more will be added in the future.
